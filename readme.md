## goals
<!-- - hud plugin to a tcp sockets (0_guest like)  thx to zimmflo -->
- seperated thread for refreshInstanceData 
- rewrite 1_host/utils/combat.py
- split 0_guest, 1_host, hud plugins by different repos, for easy updating via git
- sell items via auction house for exalts, if too many exalts, buy div
- map device fixes?
- poe2 quest bot
- recycle maps for higher tier
- make it buy/reroll/defer items from ritual with some logic
<!-- - mapdeivce2 rewrite dragtomapobject -->
<!-- - either ingame lootfilter or more accurate pickup or force sell to vendor everything outside of loot picker  -->
<!-- - vaal maps if possible -->
<!-- - towers -->
<!-- - apply deli to maps -->
<!-- - migrate and adapt QuestArea cpass from 1_host/quest.py for poe2 mapper -->
